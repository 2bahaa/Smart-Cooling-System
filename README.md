# Smart-Cooling-System
The Smart Cooling System utilizes the ATmega328P AVR microcontroller to efficiently manage temperature. Key components include a temperature sensor, Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), Timer0, and an LCD display. 
The system continuously monitors ambient temperature using the sensor, with the ADC converting the analog signals to digital values for the microcontroller to process. When the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold, the microcontroller activates a cooling mechanism, such as a fan or Peltier module. Timer0 ensures precise timing for the cooling operations and updates the LCD display with current temperature readings and system status. Users can easily monitor and adjust settings via the LCD interface, making the system both user-friendly and energy-efficient. This versatile solution is ideal for various applications, including home and office cooling, server rooms, electronic device cooling, and greenhouses.
